# v2-claude-project-charter
This is an updated version of my project charter that I did using Claude.
I made changes to the project's goal, from build a website for feedback to build a website AND use it strategically for job search with measurable actions.
The deliverables now include both the tool (website) and the outcomes (applications, networking, validation).
